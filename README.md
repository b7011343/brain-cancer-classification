# brain-cancer-classification

This project explores the various methods we can leverage machine learning to diagnose and locate various forms of brain cancers (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, negative diagnosis) from MRI images. ```demo.ipynb``` contains the final deliverable, which utilises a CNN, or convolutional neural network, (see ```models/CNN.ipynb``` for model training) to achieve a classification accuracy ~99%.
